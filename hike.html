            <h3>Dream Lake</h3>
            <div class="dream-lake">

            <p>Located in the heart of Rocky Mountain National Park, this trail is a hike everyone must do. Despite the relatively short hike (2.2 out and back), Dream Lake is almost straight out of a fairy tale.  It's early morning views are spectacular and often make some of the most sought after photographs in the state.</p>

            <p>This is perfect trail for snow shoeing in the winter, conditions permitting.  Wildlife often frequent the trail ranging from elk, deer, fox, to small squirrels.</p>

            <p>What are you waiting for?</p>

            <h3>Manitou Incline</h3>

            </div>
            <p>Arguably one of the most difficult and shortest hikes you will encounter in Colorado.  Located just south of Colorado Springs, the Manitou Incline is the ultimate workout and can even be ran up depending on how intense of a workout you are looking for.</p>

            <p>The trail is approximately 3.5 miles roundtrip, with an elevation gain of 2,000 feet.  It is not recommended to try this if you have back/knee pain, due to the extensive climbing and movement required.  The view at the top is well worth the trek.</p>

            <p>Think you can handle this?</p>

            <h3>Green Mountain</h3>

                </a>
            </div>
            <p>For those looking for a day trip just outside the Denver metro area, Green Mountain is the trail for you.  Located right in the heart of Boulder, this trail is perfect for those looking for a fun, yet challenging, family-friendly hike. </p>

            <p>The trail is longer (6 miles out and back) and will take about 3-4 hours to complete, offering great views of Indian Peaks and the other 14ers in Colorado.  You are able to take multiple routes to get to the top and bottom.</p>

            <p>Check out the first and second flatiron trail, for a full day of hiking after.</p>

            <h3>South Boulder Peak</h3>

                </a>
            </div>
            <p>Great for the experienced hiker looking to escape the Boulder crowd, and pack in a full day of hiking.  This trail is about 8 miles (out and back) with pretty views of the flatirons and testing out your cardio, with an elevation gain of 3,090 feet.</p>

            <p>Plan on a full day trip with access to Bear Peak, another favorite hiking trail for many.  Bear Peak adds about 30 minutes to the hike and is accessible from the summit, giving you the ability to knock off 2 peaks in Boulder.<p>

            <p>Up for the challenge?</p>
